> **A robust, scalable, and pattern-driven multimedia management system developed as part of the Software Engineering & Multimedia Systems Final Project.**

---

## 📖 Project Overview

The **Smart Multimedia System** is a Java-based application designed to manage and play various media streams (Audio/Video) efficiently. Built upon core **Software Engineering principles**, this project emphasizes modular architecture, design patterns, and clean code practices. It serves as a practical implementation of the System Development Life Cycle (SDLC), from requirements engineering to deployment.

This project was developed for the **Faculty of IT**, **University College of Applied Sciences**, under the supervision of **Mr. Firas F. Al-ijla**.

---

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Dynamic Media Playback:** Seamlessly switch between Audio and Video streaming modes.
- **Strategy Design Pattern:** Implements flexible algorithms for media handling without modifying core logic.
- **Modular Architecture:** Clean separation of concerns (Model, View, Controller, Strategy).
- **AI-Assisted Development:** Selected modules (UI) were optimized using AI tools to ensure consistency and efficiency.
- **Version Control:** Fully managed via **Git & GitHub** with documented commit history.
- **UML Modeling:** Comprehensive system modeling including Use Case and Class Diagrams.

## 🏗️ Project Structure

The codebase is organized into logical packages to ensure maintainability and scalability:

```text
MultimediaSystem
├── com.media.main          # Application Entry Point
├── com.media.model         # Data Entities (MediaFile, User)
├── com.media.strategy      # Design Pattern Implementation (Audio/Video Strategies)
├── com.media.controller    # Business Logic (MediaPlayer Context)
├── com.media.ui            # User Interface (AI-Assisted)
└── com.media.utils         # Helper Functions
```

---

## 🎨 Architectural Design

### Design Pattern: Strategy Pattern
We utilized the **Strategy Pattern** to define a family of algorithms (Audio vs. Video playback), encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable. This allows the playback method to vary independently from the clients that use it.

- **Interface:** `MediaStrategy`
- **Concrete Strategies:** `AudioStrategy`, `VideoStrategy`
- **Context:** `MediaPlayer`
